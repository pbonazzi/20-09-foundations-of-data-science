# Practical 2: Generative and Discriminative Models

In this practical, you will compare the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression on two different datasets. As part of the practical you should briefly read the following paper:

On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes

Andrew Y. Ng and Michael I. Jordan

Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2001.

The paper is available here: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020-on-discriminative-vs-generative-classifiers-a-comparison-of-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes.pdf

You should read the Introduction and the Experiments section. The goal in this practical is to qualitatively reproduce some of the experimental results in this paper. You are strongly encouraged to read the rest of the paper, which is rather short and straightforward to read, though some of you may want to skip the formal proofs.
