# Practical 3: Convolutional Neural Networks

In this practical, you will build a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits. You will also visualize the convolutional filters learnt in the first convolutional layer, as well as the image patches in the dataset that result in the strongest activation of these filters. You will need to handin your code defining the model, the accuracy on the test data (you should get about 98% accuracy), and the visualizations. This practical will use the MNIST dataset and Tensorflow to implement neural networks.
