# Contributions

We decided to solve all three practicals separetely to minimize misunderstanding in a later stage and maximize the understanding of the material. Therefore, we declare that every member has done all three practicals individually. The final solution include the best pieces of code and text explanations that , as a group, we were able to produce.

To check individual contribution, one can check the "individualcodes" folder inside each project folder( p1,p2,p3)

# Projects Reports
The project report of each project is written at the end of jupyter notebook(.ipynb) of respective using markdown cell.

# Solutions .ipynb files

### Navigation
The folder P1 corresponds to the first practical, P2 to the second, P3 to the third.
Each folder itself contains the group solution in pyth file, the data used for the solution (if any) are in the folder "Data" and all the documentations in the folder "Documentations".

### Final Solution file path
Project 1:  
    
    p1/p1_final.ipynb

Project 2:  
    
    p2/p2_final.ipynb

Project 3: 

    MNIST : p3/p3_final_ANN_MNIST.ipynb
    Cifar10 : p3/p3_final_TransferLearning.ipynb

# Checkpoints for Project 3
Checkpoints for MNIST and Cifar10 has been uploaded to seafile with mnist.h5 and cifar10.h5 file names repectively

Note: You can also find the MNIST checkpoint in github path : p3/mnist.h5
